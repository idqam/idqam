- 👋 Hi, I’m @idqam (Owen Villareal) and im primarly a math major with a fresh start in computer science. 
- 👀 I’m interested in the intersection of math and computer science, mainly in the areas of AI(reasoning, learning, etc),Logic, Dynamical Systems and their computations, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of artificial intelligence and the C programming language. Finnish and Norwegian are something I learn as a hobby too :). 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on really anything, I want to get my feet in the ocean that is computer science.
